# electron-tail

Aim: a cross-platform file tailing app based on electron, and nicely configurable a la hyper or VS Code

Questions:
1. Is there already a project like this?
1. What are people's favourite features from tail apps?

Features:
- Open one or more files and follow tail
- View files in tabs (or interleaved)
- Highlight terms (some predefined with a click, like ERROR)
- Search and filter terms
- show only/suppress lines based on keywords (expand collapse with one click)
- collapse prefix
